# MORPHER: Structural Transformation of ill-formed Rows
Welcome to the MORPHER project, developed at the Information Systems Group of the Hasso Plattner Institute. MORPHER provides a user-friendly interface, enabling easy interaction with the tool for efficient data preparation operations.

## SURAGH Integration

MORPHER leverages our error detection system SURAGH, which is a powerful pattern matching system designed to identify ill-formed rows in CSV files. SURAGH's code repository can be accessed at the following link: [SURAGH Project Repository](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/SURAGH)

Please note that the SURAGH project repository contains the code, documentation, and additional resources associated with the project.
